# Rumikub
Rumikub simulator in c++.

Project done in Programming Fundamentals II during my first year at university.
Consists of a simulation of the card game "Rumikub", where you have to get rid of all your cards (grouping them with the ones on your hand or the ones on the table by same number diferent color or making color straights). If you cant play any card on your turn, you draw one from the deck. 
The project is divided in headers and cpp files to make it easier to navigate.
Project done with Cameron Sanchez.
